    "In this assignment we will train a contracting-expanding convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform semantic segmentation of the prostate gland on MRI. Specifically, this algorithm will be implemented as a three-class classifier: background; transitional zone of the prostate; peripheral zone of the prostate. The ability to properly capture this anatomic context is a critical first step in characterizing a potential prostate lesion.\n",
